<a name="odd"></a></p><h3>Odd errors that cause mysterious &amp; peculiar problems</h3>
There are several problems which are not normally detected, and can show up as false warnings of 
other problems.  
<ul>
<li>Most notable of these is the <i>"too many wads"</i> error.  If you have more than 8 wads in WC, 
then weird problems CAN occur - but not always, and not for everyone.  Always check that you do not 
have too many wads when your problem doesn't "fit" the solutions...<br>
</li><li>Another odd problem that shows up elsewhere is the <a href="#rload">bad sky enviornment name</a>.   
For most of us a bad sky enviornment name leaves us with the default enviornment.  But for some 
mappers, this can cause odd error warnings: like a bad brush that does not exist, or brush outside 
of map, or bad lighting in the map.  Make sure you get that name RIGHT!  If the six sides are sky_lf, 
sky_rt, sky_up, etc. you use "sky_" in the cl_skyname field.<br>
</li><li>A third odd problem is <i>too small textures</i>.  If one over stretches the texture more than 
10x, then zoner's compile tools usually give a warning.  But there is little or no warning if you 
shrank the texture too far.  When you get a frustating error that doesn't make sense, this one is 
something to keep in mind. 
</li><li>A rare fourth problem is a single HUGE .wad that is too big for memory.<br> 
</li><li>If you have the a problem like malformed face and you do a check but do not get that error, but
<a href="#solidentity">"Solid entity is empty"</a>, you may be a victim of the editor mixup.
</li></ul>

<h1>errors &amp; solutions assembled by Tommy from many sources</h1>
<p>

<a name="hammer"></a></p><h2>Hammer Editor problems</h2>
The new Hammer editor/WC 3.4 is a bit buggy and glitchy.  It especially 
seems to have problems with Geoforce Video cards, WinXP, and Voodoo 
Video cards.  <b>Possible solutions</b>: Right now, there are three known solutions that may or may not work for you: <br>
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="http://www.compsoc.man.ac.uk/~afoster/sgi-opengl.zip">SGI's OpenGL driver</a>
 (438,888 bytes) instead of your video card's native OpenGL drivers.  
Extract the file named opengl32.dll to your WorldCraft/Hammer directory.<br>
</li><li>Upgrading your video drivers to the latest version.  Check out: <a href="http://nvidia.com/view.asp?PAGE=windows2000">nVidia's driver page</a>.<br>
</li><li>Downgrading your video drivers to a prior version, the most recent driver may not be as stable as older versions.<br>  
</li></ul>
There may also be problems converting your old WC 3.3 maps to 
Hammer/WC3.4, the best solution for this is to open your old level in WC
 3.3, copy EVERYTHING, then open Hammer, start a new map and paste it 
all in.<br>
There have also been problems with longer map names in Hammer, 
especially with compiling.  Like WC, you should compile outside of 
Hammer with a batch file or front end.  And there are more minor 
problems.<br>
If you have problems with Hammer forgetting your settings so you have to
 set it up every time, this happens to some CPUs.  The version of Windoz
 you are using may be causing it (esp. WIN ME), or something else.  The 
fixes I have heard of are:
<ul>
<li>Using an older version or different of Windoz.
</li><li>Try to always use a User Profile.
</li><li>Make changes to the .wad files installed, then save.
</li><li>Change the save maps folder to a sub folder deeper down.
</li><li>try to configure [Worldcraft] and then create and save any map, even a single wall will do, you can 
exit the program and load again and your configuration files will load. If they don't however you 
can do the process again and it normally works the second time - sometimes. 
</li><li>Open the My Computer folder and press F3 to open the search window. Search for files named *.wc. 
If you find them outside of your Worldcraft/Hammer folder, move them into your Worldcraft/Hammer folder. 
(Do this while Worldcraft/Hammer is not running) Things should work properly after doing this.....maybe.
</li><li>installing Worldcraft/Hammer into a path with no spaces (ie: C:\Worldcraft) 
</li><li>Moving everything to the default setup in <b>c:/prog**/valve h***</b> which has spaces...conflicts with the one above.
</li><li><a title="Autolycus from the VERC caught this one.">In one case where WC/hammer would not 
reinstall right, it was found you had to hand remove from the
registry <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Hammer</b> before reinstalling.</a>
</li></ul>
good luck.
<p>

</p><h2>Textures overlap in WC/Hammer editor 3D veiw</h2>
If you have this problem in WC/Hammer, the only known solutions are to 
change your display size or to reduce your .wad files in WC to 1 or 2. 
(the problem seems to start with 3 wads or more.)
<p>
</p><hr>

<a name="malformed"></a><h2>Malformed face normal</h2>
Description: The texture alignment of a visible face is unusable <br>
Howto Fix: If using Worldcraft, do a check for map problems and fix any occurences of <a href="#bigtexture">'Texture axis perpindicular to face'</a>.  Coordinates are usually given, use them if map problems cannot find the problem brush.<p>

</p><h2>SubdivideFace: didn't split the 4-sided polygon @(coordinates)</h2>
In the only case I know of this, it was the walls surrounding a level map.  I have no idea of the cause yet of this BSP error.

<h2>host_error backward mins/maxs</h2>
"It means that the mins and maxs ( the bounding box ) for the sequence 
is "reversed" (one of the mins is bigger than the maxs). This happens 
when anything calls SET_SIZE with bad extents. If you compiling your own
 code, you can wrap the setsize() calls and check it yourself, but 
that's probably not a simple answer."<br>
Translation: Do you have any special models or prefabs? they may have been screwed up, or you somehow 
turned a brush inside out, no idea how that could have happened - but some entitys like <i>platforms</i>
 seem 
prone to this. You can also look for a brush with bad extents, or check 
the texture, is it divisible by 16 on the edges EXACTLY? Finally, are 
you using the most 
modern version of zoners tools? Old versions or ancient qtools are more 
prone to this error.<p>

</p><h2>"tiny penetration in Hull 4"</h2>
In the cases I know of this, it was caused by using the -verbose switch 
to try to find an error while compiling.  The warning was ignored 
without any problems then.  I hope you too can ignore it without further
 problems. I have no idea of the cause yet of this BSP error.

<a name="recursive"></a><h2>sv_recursivehall(hull?)check:bad node number</h2>
Bad brush work, overlapping brushes, these will result in bad clipnodes or leafnodes and cause this
rare problem.  It seems to depend on compiler sensitivity also.<p>

<a name="leafface"></a></p><h2>Max_leaf_faces </h2>
You have gone over a limit similar to <a href="#maxpatch">max patches</a> error, but by BSP creating 
too many leaf faces for VIS to handle - probably due to "shattering" of a brush.  Did you carve a 
complex brush (like a cylinder) or intersect it with another brush?<p> 

</p><h2>short ### surfaces</h2>
Similar to <a href="#leafface">max leaf faces</a>error or <a href="#numplanes">ReadSurfs (line xxxxx): 32189 &gt; g_numplanes</a> error, in this one you are running out of face planes for the map.  The one occasion I read of this, it was caused by a <a href="#leak">leak</a>
 while running in software mode, although it may also be caused by over 
shrunk textures forcing too much tiling and making r_speeds of wpolys 
&gt; 800.
<i>(Leaks keep the outside of a level map, so there are more surfaces the engine sees.  However, 
this is NOT only a leak error, it is a too many surfaces error and can be caused by other things!)
<br>
see also: <a href="#skyboxing">skyboxing</a></i>.
<p> 

</p><h2>short ### edges </h2>
Like <a href="#maxpoints">maxpoints</a> error, in this one you are 
running out of edges.  This is probably caused by running in software 
mode and having bad r_speeds with wpoly counts higher than 800....and 
maybe by making complex brushes like cylinders intersecting and causing 
shattering.
<p>

<a name="parsemark"></a></p><h2>Mod_parseMarksurfaces: bad surface number</h2>
Cause &amp; solution as yet unknown to me.  Seems to happen when 2 maps/prefabs are joined into a map.
<p>

<a name="chop"></a></p><h2>MAX_TRI_TRIS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAX_TRI_POINTS  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAX_TRI_EDGES</h2>
An old RAD error code in outdated zoner's versions.  Solution, get a newer version.<p>

</p><h2>Warning: ChopWinding: Rejected(1) due to too many points</h2>
<blockquote>Merle says, "A winding is a data structure used in the compile tools to store a set of points. As 
they are very versatile, they can be used to describe a number of things (<i>surfaces, brush faces, 
brush sides, whole brushes, etc...</i>). Your Warning (<i>note: which is not an Error</i>.) message is simply 
alerting you to the fact that one of these winding data structures has a larger number of points than 
expected, and one of the points was ignored.<br> 
"It is hard to guess what casues this as most of the typical causes (<i>eg. brush sides with large 
numbers of vertexes</i>) should be really caught earlier on in the process. Hence, it is most probably 
the artifact of some subdivision or modification of the points of the map itself during the compile, 
which makes it even harder to track down. <br>
"I recommend using the 'Big Block' method of trying to isolate a particular area of your map that 
causes it, and to modify/simplify/change the general brush geometry. This is a very generic fix, 
but its also a very generic message."</blockquote><p>

<a name="shutdown"></a></p><h2>ShutdownOpenGL-wglMakeCurrent failed</h2>
This is a bug in the new WC 3.4/Hammer editor.  It seems safe to ignore....or you could make sure you
have the latest OpenGL drivers for your video card.  

<a name="spawnull"></a><h2>Spawned a NULL entity</h2>
You did some setting wrong with a monstermaker entity somehow.<p>

<a name="emptybox"></a></p><h2>The box is empty</h2>
A WorldCraft error - You are trying to make a flat box/level. Won't work, it has to be at least 1*1*1 unit big. <p>

</p><h2>Empty Map</h2>
You forgot to give the compiler the name of the level you mapped, or you haven't made the level yet!  
You can't compile nothing!  Sometimes this is a mis-error, and something else is the problem.<p>

</p><h2>Parsing Entity 0, expected '{' got '@RMF'</h2>
<a title="thanks rsearle &amp; ninjagrinch">You are trying to compile a .rmf file, instead of the .map 
file. These are different file formats, even if they deal with the same levelmap you are making.  
Make sure you export your level to .map and then use the c:/path..../mapname.map with the compile tools!</a> <p>

</p><h2>Error: ParseEntity: EOF without closing brace</h2>
WorldCraft is having difficulty exporting your .map version, somehow the
 end got chopped off.  Means you've hit the end of the file and were 
missing a close brace "}". Its posible that the exporting procedure 
ended before it was done or you included quotations or other braces in 
entity string value names (bad idea).  fixes: <br>
1. try again to export your level from WC/hammer into .map format. and retry compile. <br>
2. check in your level for entitys with "" or {} in the path/names.<br> 
3.open .map version with wordpad, go to end, add a bunch of closeing braces }}}}}
then try recompiling again. <p>

<a name="badstring"></a></p><h2>Host_Error: Bad String</h2>
This rare error only happens in game/server mode when sprites, models, 
sounds, or text strings (but not all strings!) are initialized and 
precached. If the string/name for the sprite, model, sound, or 
miscellaneous text string either starts with a non-printable ASCII 
character, or is 0 length (ie: starts with a non-printable null ASCII 
character), then the error will occur.<br>
Solution: search thru entities like env_glow, env_sprite, 
ambient_generic, env_shooter, etc. - anything the engine has to precache
 a file for the bad name.<p>

</p><h2>Line 5197 is incomplete (did you place a " inside an entity string?)</h2>
This means that you have placed an invalid character (",'%, etc) in an 
enitity property/name. This can also mean that you have untextured faces
 in your map(areas with a white appearance as a texture.) <p>
Fix any "invalid texture" errors that show up in the "Check for problems" app. </p><p>

<a name="unmatched"></a></p><h2>"unmatched target field (start_apc0)" </h2>
Somewhere in one of your entitys there is a named target which does not 
exist, for example (start_apc0).   Possibly you misspelled the entity 
targetted, or the entity was removed at some point.  You will probably 
have to go through ALL of your entitys to find it - most tedious - in 
WC/hammer use the entity report to make it faster. 

<h2>"unmatched key value"</h2>
You get that error when you personally type a key into an entity (with 
Smartedit off), and then WC can't find that key in the FGD file. If you 
know that you typed the key right and it works, the error is nothing to 
be conserned about. However, double check.<p>

</p><h2>My SKY is flashing, distorted or white</h2>
This is an error that came with the HL 1009 update in Spring 2002.  The problem is the update no longer reads the
Valve pak0pak.pak file for the default SKY enviornment TGAs.<br>
The solution is to get <b>pakexplorer</b> prgm and open the valve 
pak0pak.pak, then unpak the gfx/env folders and place them under valve 
as valve/gfx/env....with all the missing TGS files that go with those 
folders.<p>

</p><h2>tracker UI not valid, not loading</h2>
This is an error in half life patch 1110. Annoying but nothing to be 
concerned about. IF you want to aviod it, just go into 
Half-Life/valve/cl_dlls folder and change GameUI.dll to GameUI.bak.<p>

<a name="nobsp"></a></p><h2>there is no bsp/Map not found on server</h2>
Lots of possible causes for this, here are some of the most common:
<ol>
<li>This means you probably failed a compile, or you never compiled.  You must compile your level to make the .bsp map!  
</li><li>If you did try to compile, go to your /maps folder and look at 
your .log for the compile with a text editor.  You will probably find 
one (or more) of the other errors listed on this page.
</li><li>If you had no errors, did you copy the .bsp from your WC/maps folder into your mods map folder?
</li><li>It could be something else like a <a href="#odd">bad sky enviornment name</a>, or 
</li><li>making the SKY into an entity, or 
</li><li>using the wrong fgd file to make your level, or 
</li><li>You probably set the configurations of directories wrong, or 
ect. in worldcraft/hammer. Best thing to do is to have worldcraft/hammer
 not run the map after compile, and just run the game yourself, and play
 the map on LAN.
</li><li>If you typed in "map mapname" (where mapname is the name of 
your map without .bsp) in the console and didnt run it from 
worldcraft/hammer, just try typing it again, without quotes, and include
 the .bsp at the end. If that doesnt work, disclude the .bsp just to try
 again.
</li><li>If the mod for a multiplayer cannot find your map, perhaps you 
forgot to put in a player deathmatch, a player_start, or your mod 
equivalent?
</li><li>Also newer patches of HL require for HDTV the following entitys, depending on your mod: <i>Info_player_start, Info_player_observer</i>.
</li><li>STEAM is one of our newest causes for this problem.  Make sure you have everything set up right for mapping with STEAM.
</li></ol>
<p>

</p><h2>Host_Changelevel2: Couldn't load map....</h2>
Usually for single player mods/maps, for some vague reason if you have connected maps, your second one 
(or other) would not load.  Check:
<ul>
<li>the info_landmark entity.
</li><li>can you load your second map through the console?
</li><li>is your map in the right folder? 
</li><li>did you load the first map through the console?
</li><li>the map naming conventions.
</li><li>player starts.
</li><li>anything else you can think of.
</li></ul>
<p>

<a name="portalclip"></a></p><h2>MakeNodePortal:new portal was clipped away from node@(coordinates)</h2>
This indicates an invalid solid of some kind. You will need to find the 
brush at the coordinates listed and delete/recreate it.  Usually this 
vague problem only happens in the older Q compiling tools, if you 
install and use the newer  versions of Zoner's Compiling tools the 
problem will go away, or be given a more specific named error.  However 
sometimes even in zoner's this shows up, due to <a href="#malformed">Malformed face normal</a>.<br>

<h2>SZ_Getspace Overflow on netchan</h2>
A bad vague one - some server error caused by a bad map.  In one situation of this I know of, it was solved by 
copy/pasting the ENTIRE level over into another .rmf file; when another time it occured it was solved
by reducing the number of doors that used the same sound.  In a third it seems it was caused by too many
player start entities?, and in a fourth by a bad .wav file.  But really I don't know if this was really caused by 
the WAVs, or by bad brushes, ghost entitys, or what.  good luck figuring it out!<p>

<a name="portalfile"></a></p><h2>"Portal file xxxxxx does not exist...."</h2>
This can be a tough one.  If the error causing it is clearly named in the .log of the compile with 
coordinates, then it is easy to fix.  However, if the error is not showing up, it is time to go 
hunting.  You could look at <a href="#token">Token too large</a> or some of the other errors.  Check 
your <a href="#odd">Sky environment name, Wad count, ect</a>.  You may even try reinstalling a new 
copy of the compile tools in case they got corrupted, it has happened!<p>

</p><h2>"LoadPortals: failed to read header" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LoadPortals: couldn't read.... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LoadPortals: not a portal file &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LoadPortals: reading portal.... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LoadPortals: portal.... has too many points </h2>
This can happen in compile: an error occured while loading the xxxxx.prt
 file. It could be corrupted, missing (if you have a leak), or your map 
is too complex for bsp to generate a valid .prt file. Somehow the portal
 file made by the other previous compiling programs got messed up, or 
the reading program is messed up.   Usually a Qtools problem, rare on 
Zoner's compile tools, but most often happens between BSP and VIS.

<a name="pts"></a><h2>"cannot find pts file"</h2>
xxxx.pt# and xxxx.pts are files made in compiling by the compiling tools. Usually when you get 
"can't find .pts" it means something went wrong with compile. It could be a bad setup you made for 
the compile, or you're Running WC/hammer thru normal instead of expert, or having <a href="#odd">"too 
many wads"</a>, or corrupted compiling tools (rare but happens), a <a href="#token">bad path/name</a> 
somewhere, or several others. The solution is generally to use a front end or batch file with zoner's 
compile tools, then the problem usually goes away or the compiling error becomes clear.<p>

<a name="interval"></a></p><h2>Mod_LoadSpriteGroup: interval&lt;=0</h2>
Uncertain: When HL engine was loading sprites into its game cache something went wrong. 
This may mean a corrupt pak file, or a memory problem like 
<a href="#precache">precache</a>, or a weird one like 
<a href="#wrongversion">Mod_LoadBrushModel:maps/<mapname.bsp>has wrong version number</mapname.bsp></a>.

<a name="wrongversion"></a><h2>"Mod_LoadBrushModel:maps/mapname.bsp has wrong version number [571084155 should be 30]" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mod_LoadBrushModel: Sprites(lgtning.spr has wrong version number (0 should be 30)</h2>
Here are a few of the problems that popped up under this situation:<br>
<ol>
<li>You may have errors in your compile, if not then,
</li><li>Your pak0pak.pak file may be corrupted?
</li><li>Maybe the wrong game version? 
</li><li>Wrong WC/Hammer version?  Earlier versions of WC were particularly prone to this.  Use WC 3.3 or Hammer!
</li><li>Maybe another compile will make it go away, or not?  And make 
sure you have the most up-to-date version of zoner's compiling tools....
</li><li>You may have a bad model - like one from another mod or game, 
or you once installed a custom one?  Or you may have a corrupted sprite 
or model?
</li><li>Have you installed a patch recently?  It might be bad....
</li></ol>

<h2>"Could not validate Half-Life"</h2>
A similar problem to wrong version above.  Solutions are:
<ol>
<li>reinstall Half-Life and the update patches for HL and the mod.(this 
is usually the fix).  But before you do that do a virus scan and a 
diskcheck/check for back blocks on the harddrive.
</li><li>reinstall WorldCraft sometimes fixes it.
</li><li>otherwise look above to <a href="#wrongversion">wrong version</a>.
</li></ol>

<a name="serialize"></a><h2>SerializeRMF()v2.2 tried to load a file v0.0 Aborting</h2>
This World Craft/Hammer editor error means you are mix matching prefabs and maps made in different 
versions of WC/Hammer.  Sometimes this is bogus, and then it means the level has been corrupted, 
or WC/Hammer has been corrupted.  See also <a href="#texturedef">missing [ in texturedef</a>.<p>

<a name="velocity"></a></p><h2>velocity too low on func_pushable </h2>
This means that this func_pushable(s) is\are falling infinitely through space. This can occur when you 
place the func_pushable sumberged in water, place it on an unclipped skybrush or somehow shoot an 
entity or model at\through a skybrush. <p>

<a name="blackhand"></a></p><h2>black hand &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my player/weapon model is black</h2>
This is a lighting error, the SKY looks lit, but the map, especially the players weapons are dark.  
Causes are:<ul>
<li>floor is func_walled or player is clipped way above floor somehow(elevator?),

<a title="Some info by XP-cagey:

1. aaatrigger is not subdivided up into 240x240 texture unit sized faces for texture display.
2. aaatrigger doesn't have any light patches created by the compiler for lighting calculations.
3. aaatrigger is allowed to have face extents greater than 16 units in any direction.
4. aaatrigger is not lit by the tools (it and other special textures are skipped by BuildFaceLights(), PrecompLightmapOffsets(), FinalLightFace(), in HLRAD).">
<u>AAAtrigger textures are treated special</u></a>, and should have a special lightstyle of 
255, which means 
<a title="more XP-cagey info:
(in the case of liquid textures, style 255 causes them to be displayed as fullbright).">
"<u>no light data</u>" = RAD is supposed to ignore them.</a>
<a title="thanks XP-Cagey">If AAAtrigger is going through RAD, something is wrong, most probably corruption.

</a><p>

<a name="lightstyles"></a></p><h2>Warning: Too many direct light styles on a face(coordinates given)</h2>
<i>(revised)</i>  <a title="thanks XP-Cagey, Merle and Autolycus">You have too many different kinds of 
light shining on a face(patch) of a brush: either differently named switchable lights, or flickering 
or strobing lights, or lights with a custom appearance.  You need to remove some of these lights in 
the problem area (probably where you have the most such lighting), or combine the lights' properties 
into the same style.  You <b>can</b> have more than one light shine in an area, but 3 styles maximum; 
but the lights should be the same light type/custom appearance/name(if any) if possible.  The new 
switchable texture lights count as one dynamic style if they are all the same type/custom 
appearance/name.<br> 
I am not certain about the new shadow coloring control, but I do not think that applies to the 
dynamic, just to the static background.<br>
<i>(Each face wpoly/patch can have shining on it max 4 light styles: 3 switchable/dynamic light 
styles, and 1 reserved style for the static/unchanging lightmap.  The reserved is the background 
lightmap - all the normal texture lights, light env, and lights that are unnamed and normal mode - 
no matter what the color or brightness.  The dynamic lights can be single lights or a group, as 
long as they have the same light type, same custom appearance, and the same name.  You can have 
3 sets of dynamic - eg. if the lights have the same name, but 2 different light types (eg. normal 
and flickering) and one custom appearance then they make 3 dynamic styles.)</i></a><br>
choice to fix:<br>
1. remove a bunch of lights in the area, named or lights with different types/appearance.<br>
2. change more lights to the same type - type by light properties - or same names - or same custom appearance.<br>
3. <i>(<a title="thanks Cagey!
HLRAD's qrad.cpp:
CODE  
#ifdef ZHLT_TEXLIGHT        
 //LRC:
 if (*(s = ValueForKey(ent, style)))
 {
  style = atoi(s);
  if (style &lt; 0)
   style = -style;
 }
 else
 {
  style = 0;
 }
       //LRC (ends)
#endif 
">Recent info from Cagey about how the RAD code works revealed that the older compilers look at 
EVERY entity with a Style property and counts it in as a light style! This includes entities such 
as buttons that do not give off light!</a>)<br></i>
So also go thru your entitys with Smartedit off an remove Style stuff, or open up your .map of your 
level with an editor like notepad and remove the Style values from entitys like buttons that do not 
give off light really....<br>
4. <i>RAD -coring 0.2</i>  is used in some compiles with switchable lights to make light travel 
further before the cutoff, which make the switchable light look better - but it may also cause more 
styles to hit a particular face.  If you are using the coring parameter with RAD, consider removing 
it from the compile.<br>

<a name="decals"></a><h2>Decal will not work</h2>
Decals from decal.wad are tricky.  They should be in the decals.wad file in the right B&amp;W format.  
But if the server
has decals turned off, or your setup has decals off - then they will not show up.  Also some vid cards 
have caused problems with decals.  Also do not try to use regular .wad textures as decals, use the
textures from decals.wad, or make your own decals in the decal.wad with wally.<br>
Decals are re-sized according to the texture they are on top of.<p>

</p><h2>"bad animating texture (texture name)"</h2>
Animated textures names start off with a +0 and go to +9.  If there is a
 gap in the sequence (like +2xxxx followed by +5xxxx) or if some other 
character is used with the "+" (like +olab1_gun1or - "o" is not a 
number.) then you may get this error.  Also a texture with a bad name of
 the random beginning "-" can cause this error, even though it is not 
animating.  Sometimes it is bogus, caused by a corrupt save/export, or 
by that old <a href="#odd">"too many wads"</a> mistake.<p>

<a name="bigtexture"></a></p><h2>Larger than expected texture</h2>
This is a warning, and only a warning, that you are using a larger sized texture in your level than 
some older video cards can handle.  It is <b>not a compile error</b>, but it may cause player clients 
to sieze up if they
have an older video card, or are in Software Video Mode.  You must decide if you are going to abandon 
those players, or use another texture.  See also <a href="#check">Checkered textures</a>.<p>

</p><h2>'texture axis perpendicular to face'</h2>
For some reason a texture has been rotated on the face of a brush until it is "stick out of" the brush 
face.  Causes are usually, but not always: vertex manipulation, clipping the brush, carving the brush, 
importing a prefab, and sometimes rotating/skewing a brush with more than 6 sides - like a cylinder - 
without texture lock(tl) on.  You could try map problems to see if it finds the error - sometime it 
does, but more usually you have to hunt.<p>

<a name="manytext"></a></p><h2>"mip&gt;=loadmodel-&gt;numtextures"</h2>
Too many textures used, keep the number below 100.  However here is a different point of view, a quote from <b>Jay, VALVE programmer</b>:<br>
<blockquote> <i>This is a check on the validity of the BSP file. If this
 happens, it means that some texinfo is referencing a texture map (by 
index) that isn't in the BSP file. This shouldn't happen under any 
normal circumstances. Maybe the build failed and you have a partial/bad 
BSP?<br>
 It should be easy enough to debug if you have a map that produces the 
error. Also, the buffer for loading textures is a little larger than 
340K (256K + 64K + 16K + 4K) because it assumes 4 mip levels are present
 and the max mip level is no larger than 512x512. This is kind of a 
silly limitation now, but it's a real one in goldsrc. However, looking 
at the warnings for large textures, none of them is actually over 340K 
so this isn't a problem (if that data is correct and complete). bspinfo 
may shed some light as well, but I don't recall if it prints out the 
texdata entry count - it may only print the lump size.
</i></blockquote><p>

</p><h2>My compiler askes for a wad I didn't use and don't have</h2>
<i>First, I hope you check the spelling of the .wads you entered into the map editor.  Obvious, but never hurts to check.</i><br>
This usually happens because of the <a href="#odd">Too many Wads</a> problem.  Remove any wads from WC/hammer you did not use in your level.  Try to keep 
the maximum number of wads installed in WC/hammer 8 or less.<br>
Another solution that sometimes works is to make an empty wad, a wad 
with all the textures removed, and install it as the LAST one in 
WC/hammer - this especially seems to help Hammer map editor.<p>

<a name="invisi"></a></p><h2>I cannot see my textures</h2>
Check, if it is for textures in WC, did you put the texture into a wad 
of the right format (HL) and install it in WC?  If it is for far away 
textures in the game, did you set the map's max view distance too low?  
Are you in software mode with more than 800 wpolys in the area?  Or do 
you have too thin brushes or overlapping brushes?  Do you have <a href="#odd">too many wads</a>
 in WC/Hammer - 8 is the limit?  Did you remove the wad from WC/Hammer 
that the texture is in?  Was the texture was over streched or over 
shrunk, or adjusted to nothingness.  If your custom textures are black 
in the game, did you REMIP them in Wally? <p>
If it is an invisible texture/{transparent check all of these:
</p><ol>
<li>Does the name of the texture start with the { character?
</li><li>Is the blue 0 0 255 color?  Is it the ONLY blue?  (Wally likes to make extras.)
</li><li>Is the blue in pallette position #255? (Wally likes to move it around.)
</li><li>Is the func_illusionary set to solid mode, fx to 255?
</li><li>Again, did you REMIP in Wally?
</li><li>Are you in software mode?  Occasionally it can't see through the "clear" portions of textures.
</li><li>Finally, is there fog in the game? - that might mess things up...
</li></ol>

<h2>"textures xxxxxxx is not 16 aligned"</h2>
All textures have to have edge dimensions divisble by 16.  Check the texture 
with Wally to see if the sides are a multiple of 16 - if not resize the texture or clip it to size - 
or just don't use it! <br>
<i>Note: 16, 32, 64, 128, &amp; 256 are the BEST dimensions to use! Other dimensions like 48 or 
96 are legal, but due to engine texture resizing manipulation they will not look as good as 
"the powers of 2" edges would.</i>
<p>

<a name="linetex"></a></p><h2>my textures far off get lines in them</h2>
This can happen because a custom texture has not been properly remipped when made in Wally, or it could happen
due to z-fighting.<br>
Basically, z-fighting is due to limitations in the floating point precision calculations which your 
graphics card is 
processing, objects far away tend to fight over who has presidence to the player's view.<br>  
Put in simpler terms, if you have, for example, a poster 2 units thick on a wall and walk away from 
it, sooner or later the card's calculations will become less accurate, and will not be able to 
properly determine which is in front - the power, or the wall behind it.<br>  
So you have to be careful when putting thin entity brushes next to regular brushes.  
Making a space in the brush behind the thin one can help reduce the problem.  Also read Checkers below.<p>

<a name="check"></a></p><h2>my textures are checkered or have dots</h2>
This is often a sign of bad junctions in mapping.  Checkers comes most often from overlapping brushes.  
Dots usually come from bad joints, which come from vertex manipulation or clipping, or come from the 
translation errors from WC/Hammer .rmf format to .map format.  Sometimes these problems also come from 
too thin brushes. Occasionally checking happens because an old video card gets textures which are too 
big (over 256x256), or because the player is in software mode and there are too many wpolys seen. (800 
wpoly limit in software mode.) One more thing that can cause this is for the compiled level to ask for a texture which is not
in the loaded .wad anymore - maybe you removed the .wad from the editor, or switched in an other .wad
that is named the same but doesn't have the texture you were using?
<br>  Some solutions are: to fix the brush, to check the .map version to see 
if it is a translation error, to overlay the dots with another brush of same texture, to use smaller 
textures, to have less wpolys/brushes in the area, and to double check that the texture is in the
.wads you are using. <p>

</p><h2>WARNING: Texture lump "xxxxxx" not found </h2>
This usually means that you changed the wads installed in WC/Hammer or their locations after 
beginning the level.  Go back and make sure the WAD carrying the texture is still in WC/Hammer when 
you compile, or when you remove the brush the texture was on.  Also make sure you aren't running 
an -onlyents compile by mistake.  But it could also be the <a href="#manytext">too many textures</a> 
problem or it could be that old <a href="#odd">"too many wads"</a> mistake.<p>

</p><h2>W_GetLumpinfo: font0 not found</h2>
Did you move or delete the fonts.wad file from where the game needs it? 
 This fonts.wad file is needed
by the game engine, and should not be deleted or moved - and along with 
gfx.wad &amp; cached.wad, they also should not be installed into
the map editor either, since you cannot use the "textures" in mapping; 
gfx, cached &amp; fonts.wad will just 
cause a problem later when you compile.  Just leave them alone in the 
folder.<p>

</p><h2>WARNING: Unable to load xxxxx\.wad </h2>
You probably did not put the path/name of the wad correctly in WC/Hammer setup, or you moved/deleted 
the wad since you set WC/Hammer up.  It could also be you tried to load an illegal .wad into the
editor for the map - see <i>W_GetLumpinfo: font0 not found</i> above.
But it could also be the that old <a href="#odd">"too many wads"</a> mistake, or a bad brush - 
also bad texturing has set this one off.<p>

<a name="wav"></a></p><h2>I cannot hear my wavs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Warning: Unable to open sound/C for transfer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 com_loadfile: bad usehonk</h2>
Wavs are tricky.  You must use the perfect path/name, with the right 
capitals; sometimes even just adding or dropping the .wav extension in 
the name can fix things.  If there are many wavs, you have to watch your
 sound card channel limits, or you will lose 
sounds/ambient_generics/wavs.  If the problem is a custom wav, it has to
 be under the max size limit of less than  3 minutes, in the right 
format. (format is: <b>unsigned, 8bit, mono, one start cue, 11025Hz PCM</b>.)<br>
You can also try typing <i>developer 3</i> into the console while 
playing the map, then walking through a trigger that targets the wav.  
The report may give a hint as to what is wrong. <p>

</p><h2>sound overrun</h2>
Probably your wav is longer than 3 min, get a shorter one.  However, other (unknown as yet) problems have caused this to appear.<p>

</p><h2>WARNING! sound/mapsounds/arc_tango.wav is causing runtime sample conversion!</h2>
On some sound cards this happens.  Many times it is meaningless and can be ignored, but if  there 
are problems see <a href="#wav">can't hear my wavs</a> above.<p>

</p><h2>S_Findname - out of sfx_t</h2>
Uncertain, but as a guess:
<a title="thanks for the guess, Merle!">S_Findname() function could not find the name of a sound 
effect data structure.</a><p>

<a name="vmod"></a></p><h2>Unknown Command: VMod Enable</h2>
This is a bug with Half-Life version 1.1.0.8, a problem with a voice command function in multiplayer 
I believe, it's annoying but w'ell just have to put up with it until it's fixed in a later version.<p>

</p><h2>emit_sound : pitch 346 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "sv_startsound: sound = 2550"</h2>
This is a sound collision that can happen when 2 entitys try to make the same sound at the same time.  An example: <i>2
 trains running the same rail sound, both trains started by the same 
button so they try to open the sound file at the same time.</i>   The only known solution is to turn off the sound fx for both entitys....but that was for one case, feel free to experiment! <br>
 (<i>For the SV also see <a href="#precache">SVC_BAD</a> - since I am 
uncertain if it may not be related to memory overflow of too many 
entitys loading too many wavs into the precache.  sv_startsound is just a
 guess so far....</i>)<br>
 You can also try typing <i>developer 3</i> into the console while 
playing the map, then walking through a trigger that targets the wav.  
The report may give a hint as to what is wrong.<p>

<a name="trainsound"></a></p><h2>Can't hear my train sounds</h2>
It has been reported that when you set the intial speed of a tracktrain 
to higher than 0, sometimes the train sounds do not work?<p>

</p><h2>Sentence or pitch shift ignored &gt; 16 playing</h2>
This error can show up when you are testing in map, and more than 16 
entitys stop at the same time, especially if they are func rotating, 
which has pitch changes on stop sounds. 
It is about a sound collision similar to <a href="#vmod">emit_sound : pitch 346</a> above.  
This can happen even if you are not using any sound - it may be a programming bug in the engine.<br>  
Solution is to make it so all entitys do not stop at the same time.<p>

<a name="sprites"></a></p><h2>sprites problems</h2>
Sprites are very tricky.  You must use the perfect path/name, with the 
right capitals - or it will stop the game.  The path should start with 
sprite/spritename, not the whole path name.  Sometimes <i>browsing</i> to the sprite works best, sometimes typing the path/name in works best.<br>
In WC (but not Hammer) a sprite can lock up a level map as soon as it 
opens, if the animated sprite is in one of the veiws.  The solution is 
to close up all but one view and try again to load the level....or 
remove the sprite from the WC sprites folder.<br>
 If there is fog in a game, it reacts badly with sprites, so that the 
sprite may have a black border/box, instead of invisible.  No solution 
yet.<p>

</p><h2>Entity xxx, Brush x: SKY brushes not allowed in entity </h2>
Just what it says - you made one or more faces SKY in a brush that was tied to an entity.  
SKY texture cannot be in an entity.  Either change the texture, or return the brush "to world".  
Do not just delete the brush entity - you will end up with an <a href="#noent">empty brush</a> error.  
Use the entity and brush number with a goto to find the problem.<p>

<a name="rload"></a></p><h2>R_LoadSky: Couldn't load gfx/env/cl_forestrt.tga</h2>
This is from a bad sky enviornment name. If the six sides are sky_lf, 
sky_rt, sky_up, etc. you use only "sky_" in the cl_skyname field.  Always drop any cl_ and the last 2
letters in a SKY bacground .tga name.  Another example: cl_forestrt.tga should be used as only "forest"
for the sky name.<br>
<i>Again, for most of us a bad sky enviornment name leaves us with the default enviornment.  But for some 
mappers, this can cause odd error warnings: like a bad brush that does not exist, or brush outside 
of map, or bad lighting in the map, or even a map crash when the bad sky comes into view.  
Make sure you get that name RIGHT!</i>
<p>

<a name="logic"></a></p><h2>I push button/trigger in game and get kicked out</h2>
If the compile was good, and there were no other problems, then the most common cause of this problem 
is a logic loop with the entitys.  Two or more entitys are set to call each other, and somehow you 
set them in motion - buffers fill with the loops in under a second, crash, and you are kicked out.  
Or you have named the trigger/button the same name as the entity it targets.<br>
Solution: fix the entitys.<br>
However, sometimes something else sets off the kick off, so keep an open mind.  It could be:<ol>
<li> You have a too big <a href="#wav">wav sound files</a> that starts.
</li><li> You have a corrupt <a href="#sprites">sprite</a>/<a href="#modnum">model</a> that is called up.
</li><li> You have something that moves out of the level, like a door - but it goes too far. 
</li><li> See also <a href="#precache">precache</a> and <a href="#allocblock">allocblock:full</a> for other possible causes.
</li><li>In one case where firing a gun crashed the map, it seems to have been <a href="#wav">too many 
ambient_generics with too many wavs</a> playing at the same time that went over the channel limits of 
the sound card.
</li><li>Sometimes HL/mod (such as CS) maps which have the <i>game_player_equip</i> entity also crash when players 
overload on weapons.
</li><li>You are in software mode and are entering an area with sky, but the sky you entered is not in the 
gfx/env folder.  See also: <i>R_LoadSky: Couldn't load gfx/env/cl_forestrt.tga</i> error.

</li></ol><p>

</p><h2>NON-Solid Set To Glow </h2>
You set an entity into glow mode when you shouldn't have.  Check the 
entitys in the map you made that you did not set a func_wall, or 
func_door or anything else into glow mode.

<a name="nohud"></a><h2>no HUD</h2>
In HL you get no HUD until you get the enviornmental suit.  In 
muliplayer mods you often get no HUD because you "ran"(f9) your level 
thru WC, so you are in test map mode.  To get the HUD, open up your mod,
 go lan/create your map, HUD should show up.<p>

<a name="numplanes"></a></p><h2>ReadSurfs (line 99416): 32189 &gt; g_numplanes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  max_map_planes</h2>
Before you go wild, try a recompile or 2 - sometimes it is just a random
 thing.  Also search for a brush with more than 32 faces, such as a 
cylinder in the <a href="#maxpoints">Maxpoints</a> error.<br>
Otherwise this error means you went over the limit of the number of 
planes allowed. This means too many faces in the map = too many brushes,
 or too complex ones. Time to trim back the level map! Some solutions:<ul>
<li>Do not put a box around your map to fight leaks.  Seal each section seperately and fight the leak war.
</li><li>Try to line up the faces of brushes with the same texture at 
the same scale. Then the engine may make them into one face plane.  
</li><li>Avoid detail brushes, use texture to "fake it" instead.
</li><li>Plain make fewer brushes.  Keep construction simple.  HL and complexity mix poorly.
</li><li>There are some newer compiler programs being tested that remove
 unused and unneeded planes from the outside of a level.  You could try 
to get and use one of them.
</li></ul>
<p>

<a name="noedict"></a></p><h2>no free edicts  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUM_FOR_EDICT: bad pointer</h2>
Each entity ingame takes up an edict slot, if the game ever runs out of 
edict slots you get the crash "no free edicts." Solution is to reduce 
the number of entitys in the level.  Single player mods may have a 
different number of edicts than multiplayer mods, possible due to the 
number of player entitys, sprites &amp; 
models required.  <i>Reported general HL limits are SP=900 to 1024?, MP=1365 to 2048??  your Mod may vary.</i><br>
However, in a small map with few entities, the error can also be too many of one sort of entity - 
some Mods of HL have individual entity limits.<br>
In addition the "bad pointer" may mean the bsp was corrupted, or even 
that your game engine/dll is corrupted.  Test other maps to see if it 
happens with them, and if not, get a new copy of the .bsp and retry.  If
 it continues only with that map, then it is probably too many entitys.<p>

</p><h2>node graph out of date, rebuilding</h2>
The node graph is what controls the AI basicly. It's all the routes between your info_node entities. 
Each time you change the map it must be rebuilt (which HL does). The more nodes and complexity of the 
nodes, the longer it takes. The files for the graph are in the maps/graphs folder and should be 
disrubuted with any 
final map release if it's SP. Nodes shouldn't even be in normal HLDM maps.<p>

<a name="lowmem"></a></p><h2>Memory allocation failure</h2>
Description: The program failed to allocate a block of memory. Likely causes are (in order of likeliness) :
<ul>
<li>do not compile thru WC/Hammer F9 "running" - this hogs RAM.  Instead use a front end or batch file to organize your compiling;
</li><li>the partition holding the swapfile is full (clean out your hard
 drive, empty trash, clear out unused files, purge your temp files 
folders and internet browsers temp files.); 
</li><li>swapfile size is smaller than required (let swapfile be dynamicly allocated, do not set it too small yourself.); 
</li><li>memory fragmentation (defrag your hard drive); 
</li><li>heap corruption (reboot and try again.  If you have old RAM, make sure it is seated well.  check for viruses!). 
</li><li>on at least one occasion this was caused by a corrupt prefab. 
</li><li>on at least one occasion this was solved by removing a <a href="#skyboxing">skybox</a> and so making the level smaller.
</li></ul>
<p>

<a name="allocblock"></a></p><h2>allocblock:full</h2>
A <b>tough</b> one to figure out, vague error that usually shows up when you start the game or during 
compile, or even when WC/Hammer starts up - you have gone over the memory limit somewhere for some 
reason.  It can be too little RAM (128M is about minimum), a <a href="#leafsaw">leaf saw into leaf</a>

 use a front end or batch file to compile with.  You could also get more
 RAM.<p>
(<i><b>The following may still be handy, however be aware that Software mode allocates memory dynamicly, 
so it may automaticly seem to "fix" any error.  Therefore the following info MAY lead you into a dead end:<br>
</b>Some brush-based entities have rendering properties that, when they interact in OpenGL/D3D video cards, they 
crash. Switch Half-Life to Software mode first, then load the map. If it loads you now know it is

transparencies (illusionaries, windows, ect.), env_beams and so on.</i>)</p><p>

Another insufficient memory or misallocated memory error.  Possible causes are many, including too 
little RAM &amp; also by having a texture perpendicular to the face of the solid with WC.  
In one case it was a script that shifted models one button.  Possible solutions are:<br>
1. For memory telling the HL main engine how much memory to use with <b>HL -heapsize # </b>(1024 x number of meg is popular #) 
or<b> HL -zone #</b> in the shortcut.<br>
2. For texture perpendicular go into WC/Hammer, then you can press alt +

Precache is a game memory problem. It often could be you have a bad path/name for a 
<a href="#sprites">sprite</a>/<a href="#modnum">model</a>/wav.  But it can also be that you have too many 
kinds or too large sprites, models(400 obj limit?), <a href="#wav">wav sound files</a>(limit&lt;3min) or 
entitys(data limit ~0.5M) and have overfilled the space setup for them. (see also <b>SVC bad</b>
 below.)   Sometimes combining entities into fewer helps, but usually 
you will have to simplify to fewer kinds of sprites/models, or smaller 
sprites/models/wavs.  Occasionally this error happens when you are using
 a corrupted or non-standard model/sprite.  Using other folk's prefabs 
are often hidden reasons for this problem. <br>
Sometimes the <a href="#odd">"too many wads"</a> problem sets this off, 
<a title="Some info by XP-cagey:
The compile tools are supposed to consider the aaatrigger texture as SPECIAL -- this changes the compiler behavior for aaatrigger faces at several points: 
1. aaatrigger is not subdivided up into 240x240 texture unit sized faces for texture display.
2. aaatrigger doesn't have any light patches created by the compiler for lighting calculations.
3. aaatrigger is allowed to have face extents greater than 16 units in any direction.
4. aaatrigger is not lit by the tools (it and other special textures are skipped by BuildFaceLights(), PrecompLightmapOffsets(), FinalLightFace(), in HLRAD).">
or having a brush textured with <u>AAAtrigger texture</u> visible in the map will cause this problem.</a><p>

</p><h2>SVC_BAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "500 overflow temporary ents!" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FSB_ALLOWOVERFLOW</h2>
Like Precache above, it is usually a memory problem.  This error is usually caused by too many entitys 
that create/call models - like gib shooters, breakables and pushables.  The main solution is to cut 
back on these.<br>
Another cause of SVC bad in particular is compiling with -onlyents flag and having changed the 
geometry of the map.  Also the SVC problem can happen because of various combinations of 
entities that are on the map together, it can be caused by lifts that are set in the up position when 
they have certain flags set, often a common cause of SVC bad is a bad compile where a brush based 
entity hasn't been compiled properly, so this can even be caused by a brush based entity with an 
invalid shape.  <i>SVC is a particularly tough one to figure out, good luck!</i><br>
It is also possible that the other problems as in <a href="#precache">precache</a> 
above are also causing these problems.<p>

<a name="entlim"></a></p><h2>Error: too many entities &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Too many entity's in visible packet list</h2>
That means you have too many entities visible/see-able at that time. There are two likely causes for this:<br> 
Your not running VIS, or your map has huge ammounts of entities visible at a time.<br>
Solution: run VIS -full, block line-of-sight (aka. vis blocking), combine like entitys in the same room
- but only in the same room.<p>

</p><h2>Entity Limitation notes:</h2>
<table cellpadding="8" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="40%" valign="top">
The HL engine itself has a hard limit of 2048 entities, point or brush based, which is a data limit of 
about 0.5M.  On top of that, Half-Life likes to generate it's own temporary entities 
in-game for certain effects (ie. beams, sparks, projectiles...), these temporary entities have a limit of around 500, 
see <a href="#precache">500 overflow temporary ents!</a> above.<br>
But the compile tools have a limit of only 2048 for all editor placed entitys (MAX_MAP_ENTITIES). (<i>I am
not sure if the temp entitys come out of this 2048 limit as well, but I suspect they do.</i>)
And there is a sub-limit on switchable lights of 1024 (MAX_ENGINE_ENTITIES). 
Additionally, you also have a compile side sub-limit of 400 for 
brush based entities.  Mods that use cutscenes to start a round have even lower limits - DoD
is now talking about 400-500 as the playing map limit of total entitys!  NS has a similar situation.<br>
  Moreover, there seems to be special limits 
for some entitys, like the limit of 16 rotating entitys that stop at the same time, due to the sound 
limitations.  Or the limit of 32 players in most mods, or the general 8 fixed lights shining on a 
face limit, the 3 switchable lights on a face - and so on.<br>

<a name="invalid"></a></p><h2>"Invalid Argument"</h2>
If seen in compile, this means you probably set up the compile wrong, a 
bad path/name, a bad instruction flag for a compiler, or something of 
that nature.  The solution is to go back and check and recheck 
everything to make sure it is all right. <br>
Rarely it is a freak instance that causes one of the compile programs to
 pass an invalid argument to one of its subroutines or functions (you 
may not really understand that last bit unless you do a lot with 
computer programing).  Then you should reinstall your compiling 
programs.<br>
If seen when testing a map in your mod it could be that you set up an 
entity wrong in the map, for example a sprite calling a wav file. <p>

<a name="noent"></a></p><h2>"Warning: No entities exist in hull #, no filling performed for this hull"</h2>
Fairly obvious, you made the map without putting point entitys, like player starts.  However, 
often this error will come up because an entity is outside the map; and other times this error 
will be bogus and something else lies behind it like: the  <a href="#odd">"too many wads" or other 
odd errors</a>, or you forgetting to export into .map format in WC, or a <a href="#leak">leak</a>, 
or even a corruption of your level files!  This error seems to get pulled up often for the wrong problem.<p>
</p><p>
</p><h2>Empty Entity,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solid Entity ..... is Empty &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>or</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entity has no brush</h2>
You made a brush and tied it to an entity, but somehow deleted the brush
 without deleting the entity.  An entity and brush number may be given, 
but it is still hard to find the problem - and sometimes the wrong brush
 is shown.  The best way to find the problem is to use the goto of the 
map entity report, and goto each entity of that type.  When the goto 
ends in a nowhere, showing no brush, that is probably the problem entity
 you can delete.  But continue the check just in case there are more.

<h3>persistant misnamed errors</h3>
<i><b>Solid Entitiy (entity_name) is Empty</b><br>
This error occurs when two existing brush-based entities are selected, then both tied again to an 
entity. WC/VHE asks the user which of the two entities he would like to keep, and is supposed to 
discard the other. Instead, however, WC/VHE does not discard the remaining entity, but simply strips 
it of it's brushes. Consequently, the user winds up with an empty entity.<br>
On occassion, in the case that one of the brushes that was combined had an error, WC/VHE will 
disguise the empty entity problem as that error. For instance, if a brush-entity with a malformed 
face was combined into another entity, then the malformed face error will persist in WC/VHE and 
may show up in the compile. However, when the user goes to check for the removed entity ##, he will 
find that the entity "does not exist." So in effect, the "Solid entity is empty" error was disguised 
as the malformed face error.<br>
In order to correct this, open the map in WC/VHE and press alt-P to open the map error report. 
Find the error that says Solid Entitiy (entity_name) is Empty and select it. Then press the GoTo 
button and close the error report window. WC/VHE should now be centered on the origin in the 
three construction views with nothing selected. Press the delete key on your keyboard. Repeat as 
neccessary.<br>

<a name="origin"></a></p><h2>"Origin Brush....."</h2>
ORIGIN textured brushes are not allowed in the level without being in an entity with another "visible" brush.
(<i>CLIP brushes do not count as "visible".</i>)  
Furthermore, there may not be more than one ORIGIN textured brush in an entity.  
Make sure you did not accidentally clone the ORIGIN brush, and make sure it is tied into the same 
entity as the rest of the brush it is supposed to work with, and finally make sure there is only one 
ORIGIN brush in the entity.<br>
<i>Note: For many entitys the ORIGIN brush does not have to actually 
touch the other brushes in the entity.  Example: a rotating door as a 
swinging garage door can have its "hinge"/pivot point, the ORIGIN brush,
 below and inside the room the garage door is supposed to open.</i><p>

</p><h2>"Clip Brush....."</h2>
CLIP textured brushes are not supposed to be alone in an entity.  
There should be a "visible" brush of some sort, even if it is an {invisible textured non-seen "visible".
(<i>ORIGIN brushes do not count as "visible".</i>)
CLIP textured brushes CAN be alone if they are NOT in an entity, that is how they are supposed to be used.<p>

<a name="edge"></a></p><h2>Edge with both face id's already filled.</h2>
<a title="thanks MuzzleFlash">The only time this came up, it was a bad brush with too many vertex points.</a>  See 
<a href="#maxpoints">MAX POINTS</a> error. <p>

<a name="modnum"></a></p><h2>"Mod-NumforName: xxxx.mdl not found"</h2>
Often because the cycler entity, cyler sprite or some other entity used 
has the wrong path/name.  You must use the perfect path/name, with the 
right capitals - or it will stop the game.  The path should start with 
model/modelname, not the whole path name.  Sometimes <i>browsing</i> to the model works best, sometimes typing the path/name in works best.<br>
Also if you have changed the model, for example a new player model or a 
new gib model, it can cause this problem.  Re-install the old model.<br>
Sometimes the <a href="#odd">"too many wads"</a> problem sets this off too.<p>

</p><h2>custom file has wrong number of lumps #</h2>
I have only heard of this once, and then this error was just related to a
 downloaded custom gun or player model.  Solution, switch back to the 
official standard models.
<p>

</p><h2>green "flies" around a monster or player or model has yellow/gold dots</h2>
The problem is the monster is stuck in the wall or too close to the wall
 or a brush entity. When a monster/player/model gets stuck in a wall, 
the engine  
creates those dots/flies to draw your attention, so you realize your 
mistake. Simply move him/it out of the 
wall and it will be okay.<p>

<a name="infonodeblob"></a></p><h2>had 5 small blobs of white, yellow, brown, and red dots</h2>
<a title="thanks rsearle">If you have 5 small blobs of white, yellow, brown, and red dots; 
one in the middle, and the other 4 circling clockwise.  This means you have an info_node error,

make sure you have all the most recent updates.<p>

</p><h2>host error : PF_setview_1:not a client</h2>
The only time I came across this, it was some error with a camera shot that started the level, and 
taking the camera out fixed it.  <br>
<a title="thanks EsBe / the Destroyer of Worlds"><blockquote><b>EsBe says:</b><i> 
As the name implies, this error occurs when the game tries to change the view of a non-client to that 
of the trigger_camera. What isn't so obvious is that the trigger_camera doesn't automatically target 
the player. It will target who-/whatever triggered the camera entity. <br>
Note that the game can trace the "activator" back through multiple entities. For example, if the 
player walked through a trigger_once which triggered a camera, the game knows that the trigger_once 
triggered the camera, but it also knows that the player triggered the trigger_once. The same applies 
to a func_button, etc. I'm guessing that you tried to trigger the camera with a trigger_auto. This 
would cause the camera to try to change the trigger_auto's view, not the client's, because the player 
didn't actually trigger the trigger_auto. I would assume that this error would also occur when a 
path_corner, etc., triggers a camera. </i>

<a name="fileread"></a><h2>"file read failure"</h2>
There is a problem reading the file.  The possible causes and possible 
solutions vary so much I cannot list them ALL here, but for a HL/mod 
game a few are:
<ul>
<li>corrupt bsp, needs replacing
</li><li>corrupt MOD or HL program needs replacing - a virus?
</li><li>corrupt sprite/wav/model/wad

<a name="vismatrix"></a><h2>Vismatrix too big</h2>
The other memory requirements (about half as much as the vismatrix's 
usage) plus this put you over the top in memory. This pretty means your 
physical memory + swap is less than all the memory qrad wants to 
consume. A few things to work around it:
<ol>
<li> Increase swap.
</li><li> Get more RAM.
</li><li> Compile on a computer with more RAM.
</li><li> Use a larger -chop value (default is 64) to make a smaller 
vismatrix, sacrificing quality until you can get more RAM/access to 
better machine etc.
</li><li> Use qrad with -bounce 0 (no radiosity lighting) which skips 
the vismatrix step and just does direct lighting. Uses a lot less RAM 
but lighting is only a real rough approximation of how it would look if 
it was allowed to bounce once or twice." 
</li><li> use the -sparse value on HLRAD to use less memory.
</li></ol>

<p>

<a name="swap"></a></p><h2>"Warning: SwapTransfers: unmatched"</h2>
It's often a false problem in QRAD, but sometimes real.  solutions:<br>
<ol>
<li>use zoners compiling tools, especially HLRAD.
other solutions are:<p>
</p></li><li> If the map lights fine, ignore it. End of problem.
</li><li> Undo my most recent changes, and see if the map lights then.
</li><li> Rigorously check for any bad brushes.
</li><li> Delete some lights, starting with switchable lights.
</li><li> Make some random changes in the map, usually by way of scaling
 some textures, and see if the map lights fine then. Scaling a texture 
changes how big the polygon ends up being on a large surface (and thus 
helps the speed), and it also affects the lighting of it. Outdoor areas 
usually have most of the textures scaled up 2x2 or larger. I would first
 pick textures that you won't really notice scaling on: near-black 
textures, rocks, concrete, asphalt, whatever.
</li><li> Move random brushes around, or delete brush entities.
</li><li> Pick a good spot and cut the map into two separate maps with a
 level transition. That is the most drastic but usually works if all 
else has failed. 
Other possible fixes from Neil include: 
</li><li> Use the "-extra" option.in HLRAD
</li><li> Delete the offending brush (One case was angled on several sides to a point)."

</li><li>Too long a path/name for the map or compiling tools.  Only a 
limited amount of memory is set aside for the path/names.  Solution is 
to move the compiling tools or map into a shallow folder.
</li><li>Having a space in a path/name.  Examples: frequently /<b>Program Files</b>/
 is part of the path name.  Compiling tools do not like the space 
between "program" and "files".  Solutions are to either use the MSDOS 
pathname, or to move the offending files from under the spaced folder, 
or put quotes " " around the whole path name in WC/Hammer so that 
windows uses it right.  If your map has the space in its name (eg. <b>Bob map</b>), remove the space and change it to (<b>Bobmap</b>).

The limits for -texdate can go as high as the mem of the video cards you expect to encounter.

<p>This error is always caused by vertex manipulation.  A plane is defined by 3 unique coordinates.
If any of the three coordinates are the same, then you don't really have a plane (its either a line or a point).  There
is no way to fix this error other than to delete the brush and recreate it completely.
</p><p>This is most commonly caused by dragging a vertex ontop of another to destroy it for several vertexes of the same face.
The resulting brush can even look correct, but the side which you have destroyed can still have a point or two defined for it.
The proper way to remove a face is to use a clipper.  If the object is simple (say converting a square to a wedge), then 
dragging an edge via the yellow control points to merge multiple vertexes at once will probably be safe.<br>

<p>There are a few cases that create the 'outside world' error. The 
first is an damaged brush, almost always
created by a vertex manipulation gone wrong.  The coordinates listed in 
the error are very important in
diagnosing the error.  If any of the coordinates are -9000 or 9000, then
 the brush is damaged, and
most likely needs replacing completely.  The second most common case is 
actually having a brush near or outside the edge
of the allowable region for the world.  The brushes are expanded 
slightly for some of the calculations during a compile,
so brushes near the edge within 64 units will cause the error too.  The 
cordon tool creates brushes automatically to box in the 
cordon region, and their brushes can sometimes be quite large, and also 
extend outside the world.  This can be verified by opening
up the .map created by an export with cordon enabled, and looking to see
 what brushes it made.</p><p>

<b>These 3 errors are very closely related, almost all caused by vertex problems, often at the same 
time.</b>  Causes can be you, or the editor.  Be careful when you manipulate vertexes!  But the editor
can also mess up - WC/hammer is known for this.  Rotating a brush, clipping, carving, hollowing,
copy/pasting a brush, even
moving a brush can make the vertexes go "off the grid".  This is OK with the editor, it can handle
decimal points.<br>
But when the editor exports to .map, trouble arises.  The editor seems to move the vertexes to a grid
point, often the nearest, but sometimes not.  So vertexes can end up in a line or on top of each other
(<i>no normal</i>), or move so that 2 planes line up (<i>coplanar faces</i>), or move so that an 
illegal face is made and in compile deleted - leaving a hole (<i>which results in outside world</i>).
Sometimes the editor even seems to put the vertex outside the map (<i>again, outside world</i>)! <br>
One fast way to check for this is to open your .map export with your editor, and look around.  If you
see some funky brushwork, remember what brushes are involved, then go back to the .rmf and change the
vertexes to meet the grid points.

Error: Entity 59, Brush 11: outside world(+/-4096): (-10000,-7047,-7047)-(10000,7095,7095)"><i>
For the record, a "Plane with no normal" error occurs when the three points specified for the plane 
in the map file are colinear. When that's the case, the normal is logically indeterminate... the 
program attempts to take the cross product of two edges and gets a vector of length zero, causing 
it to throw the error.
<br>
Also for the record, if a brush has a bad plane definition, that plane is skipped when calculating 
face boundaries in CSG, which is the probable cause of the "outside world" error you had for brush 
11--if you remove one 
plane from a brush and the remaining planes don't form the boundaries of 
an enclosed polyhedron, the resulting brush created by CSG is bounded by arbitrary limits set by 
program. 
<br>
That arbitrary limit for brush bounds was set just outside the legal world bounds so that logically 
unbounded shapes will be reported by the program. In the case of brush 10, the remaining plane 
intersections still define a complete solid even without the missing plane. <br>
I should note that skipping invalid planes is only one cause of "outside world" errors... two 
others are:
<ul>
 <li>explicitly creating items outside the +/-4096 bounds of allowed mapping space 
(actually "outside world") and
</li><li>creating items within (largest bounding box dimensions)/2 of +/-4096... when brushes are expanded 
for the clipping hull, they end up partially outside the world (although this could be modified, 
since simple geometry can demonstrate that any face that gets expanded across a world boundary must 
be on the exterior and should be culled unless the map leaks).
</li></ul>
If the brush being reported as outside world isn't near the edge of the map, however, a skipped invalid plane is the best bet.

<a name="mixed"></a><h2>mixed face contents</h2>
Example:<br>
    <span class="CONSOLE">
    Entity 0, Brush 12: mixed face contents<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Texture ROCK_X1 and SKY<br>
    Entity 0, Brush 37: mixed face contents<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Texture STEEL_9 and WATER7<br>
    </span>
<p>In Halflife, brushes are required to have all faces be of the same 
type (solid, water, slime, sky, origin).  
Fortunately almost all textures are solid.  If you put a water texture 
on one side of a brush which has dirt or steel textures for example, 
that would generate the error. The engine needs to know what is inside 
the brush, and it would be real confusing if different types could be 
put onto the same brush.
</p><p>
The fix is relatively simple.  Simply find the offending brush, and then
 the faces with the inappropriate texture and change it. If a brush uses
 SKY, all sides must be sky. The same is true for CLIP, and ORIGIN 
textures as well.  If you are careful it is possible to mix water 
textures (provided you don't accidently use a slime texture on the 
brush)</p><p>

Rare error.  In one case it was a bad brush from vertex manipulation. <a title="thanks Firebinder.">
In another case it was a func_door with the 'passable' flag set &amp; a large clip brush.</a>  Try an

Place a huge block over half of the level and compile with CSG and BSP only.<br> 
If compile tells you you have a leak/problem anymore, it's in the region that you didn't cover up- 
repeat step 1. Then if you still have a leak/problem, then you probably have several of them...If not, 
then carry on with this process, but use multiple blocks, each time 1/2 the size of before. <br>
Repeat process until you're using a very small block (e.g. 32 X 32 X 32). Search for the leak/problem
 using the 3D window. Then you can copy the immediate region of the map (block off corridors etc.) 
 into a new map and do the pointfile thing on it. <br>

This can happen when you have not done a complete error free compile with VIS -full and RAD,

Basicly this comes from an area whose floor is not square enough, square floor areas never give this problem. <b>Note:</b> often if there is only one leaf saw leaf in a map level, it can be ignored.  So before getting busy, see how your map plays!<br>
Solutions to try when you have a lot of leaf saws, or problems from leaf saws:
<ol>
<li><b>VIS -full compiles were designed to help with this problem, so 
the FIRST thing to try is recompile with VIS -full and see if it goes 
away.</b></li>
<li>func wall any brushes within the coordinates given for the problem, 
this will simplify VIS in the area because func wall brushes are 
invisible for VIS.</li>
<li>Move walls in the area to make the floors more square.</li>
<li>Put a HINT brush across the trouble area. HINT brushes cut VIS leafnodes, so they will reshape the area and may fix the problem.</li>
<li>Finally just start ripping brushes out of the area.</li>
</ol>

<a name="maxpatch"></a></p><h2>Exceeded MAX_PATCHES</h2>
<p>When hlrad runs, it takes all the visible faces in the game, and 
divides them into sections called patches.  These patches are the 
textures used as the lightmaps for the world.  There is a hard limit of 
65535 patches that hlrad can deal with.  By default, a 64x64 game unit 
chunk of space is the size of one patch.  If the texture scaling (not 
texture size) is larger or smaller, it will directly affect the lightmap
 size as well.  This means a texture with scale of 2, will have at best 
1/4th as many patches
as a texture with a scale of 1. 
</p><p>Putting a 'box' around the level to protect from leaks is the 
most commmon cause of this error, beyond excessively large maps.  The 
box causes vis to keep the faces on the outside which would normally be 
thrown away.  These faces are then required to have lightmaps.  Worst 
case, is that putting a box around the level will usually cause an extra
 40-80% more lightmaps to be created than necessary.
</p><p>Barring having a box, the other cause is large maps. The fixes are varied but can only help so far.
</p><ul><li>Remove any "box" from around your level and fight the <a href="#leak">leak leak leak</a> war the right way.
</li><li>If you have not boxed in your level, then the #1 fix is running HLRAD with the -sparse flag - but compile will be slower.  
</li><li>Using -chop values larger than the default 64 for hlrad will cause the light patches to be larger.  
However, for values larger than around 96 the map's lights start looking bad, and will more prominently 
show the 'staircase' effect on shadows.  
</li><li>Using a larger scale on large textures (dirt, rock walls, concrete) will help those large surfaces 
consume fewer patches for lighting.

<p>For most well designed maps, vis should have a worst case run time of
 about 45 minutes on a single p2-300 class computer.  If it is taking 
longer, then the map probably needs work to add vis blockers.  Several 
things can make vis take way longer than usual:
</p><p>First, if the world has been 'boxed in' to prevent leaks, vis has
 to spend large amounts of time on the exterior gaps which would 
normally not exist on a map without a box. 
</p><p>Second, The architecture which connects 'areas' together might be
 a bit confusing for vis to figure out.  It is somewhat difficult to 
explain, but a few examples would be: halls lacking a wall somewhere 
which is not directly on the XZ or YZ plane; halls that intersect rooms 
on a plane other than XZ or YZ, large rooms with walls that are not 
vertical; halls that connect two areas but the areas can see each other 
through the hall; Lots of little tiny brushwork in an area (especially 
large areas) that is not an entity.
</p><p>Third, vis is quickly brought to a crawl by large outdoor areas that are not extremely carefully constructed to
not too see much 'indoors'..
</p><p>And finally, using an older version of <a href="http://tarot.telefragged.com/gensurf/">gensurf</a> that does not support ZHLT's HINT brushes.
</p><p>It is highly advised experiment heavily with test maps with 
sample architecture, using software mode, r_drawflat 1, and r_draworder 1
 in order to
see how vis works.  Also, read the HINT brush tutorials described in the
 section on HINTs.</p><p>

<a name="rad"></a></p><h2>HLRAD is SLOW/stuck on makescales</h2>
<p>HLRAD requires large amounts of memory to run efficiently for all but the most trivial of maps.
</p><p>The vismatrix hlrad needs to run takes exponentially more RAM as 
the vismatrix grows.  The formula is
'number of patches' squared, then divided by 16.  This number is how 
many bytes it will consume.  The maximum is 65535 patches, so 
the maximum vismatrix is 256Mb of RAM.
</p><p>Furthermore, the amount of memory the vismatrix uses is not all 
the memory hlrad needs to run.  
Depending on the visibility of the map, the  'scales' cache consumes 
large amounts of memory at once as well.
For most maps, this amount of memory is close to 1/2 the size of the 
vismatrix.  This generally equates to a maximum of 128Mb, or
a system total of 384Mb to run the worst case (65535 patches) map.
</p><p>The makescales phase has a tendency to run fast right up until it
 runs out of physical memory and has to start relying on the swapfile.
This is frequently noticeable as makescales running quickly (say 20 
minutes) up until the 90% mark, then taking several hours to
finish the last 10%.  This is always caused by running out of physical 
memory, and the last 10% work requiring heavy use of the swapfile.
If more architecture is added to the map, one can see that it will start
 taking exponentially longer to compile, until the RAM is upgraded.
</p></font><p><font color="white">Besides simply adding large quantities of RAM to the computer, the fix for this problem is identical to fixing 
a MAX_PATCHES error.  Applying those fixes will reduce the number of patches, and cause HLRAD to need less memory,
often speeding up the compile dramatically.  If all has been done, there is also the option of using -bounce 0 with 
HLRAD, and using just direct lighting for test compiles of the map.  Ideally one would then using a non-zero -bounce 
for the final compile.

<b>VIS AND RAD KEEP CRASHING DURING COMPILE</b><p>
<i>When compiling, VIS and RAD have a tendency to become completely caught up in their work. 
Basically, unlike most other programs, VIS and RAD give your map priority over Windows.
Windows will poke every program running every few seconds (usually with a redraw command) and 
wait to see if the program gives a reply. In the case of VIS and RAD, they are usually working 
so hard on compiling the MAP file that they completely ignore and fail to respond to Windows pokes. 
The result, windows says "Not Responding" next to the program name and things may fail to be re-drawn 
(leaving ugly white program forms behind).
</i></p><p><i>
All there is to do is sit back and wait while VIS and RAD go about compiling your map. 
Compile times average a few hours even on the most up-to-date machines, so be prepared to wait a 
while. If your map is poorly constructed, you might even get your compile to take a few days 
(I've had to wait 96 hours before.. 4 days!).</i>

If the numbers given include a 0, such as 16345/0, it often (but not always) means the texture has
gone perpendicular to the face. This usually is a result of rotating the brush, clipping, carving,
hollowing or vertex manipulation, remember where you did that and you may find it faster.<br>
If it is numbers like 3456/2 or 3/532 then it usually means a stretching texture  problem.  These often come from "fitting"
a texture to a brush, especially thin brushes like signs or doors. Then a texture may get shrunk too far
also, so do not go below 0.1 for scale or over 10 for scale, either causes frequent problems.<br>
If the editor cannot find it for you, using the Big block elimination method or the cordon tool may

Third, <a href="http://www.gamedesign.net/archive/old.gamedesign.net/quake2/tutorials/hint_brush/hint_brush.shtml">Another old tutorial</a>, also for quake2, is also in the gamedesign.net archives.

<a name="clipnode"></a></p><h2>MAX_MAP_CLIPNODES</h2>
<p>There isn't any way to add more nodes or clipnodes to the bsp's (its already maxed out).  
However, at least clipnodes can be reduced with a bit of work.</p>
<p>When the maps are compiled all the 3d 'space' a player can get to is
broken up into convex regions just like brushes are required to be, alot of
them are extremely small or too small for a player, and if you put a CLIP
brush over them they don't become clipnodes at all (well really there are
still a few intersecting the brush on its surfaces, but the brush can be
excluding dozens or hundreds of them at a time).</p>
<p>If the world has had a 'box' placed around it to prevent leaks, its
probably causing several thousand (if not 10000+) extraneous nodes and
clipnodes to be caused, not only wasting resources but will cause vis to
work a lot harder than it needs to.  
<a href="http://www.valve-erc.com/content/resources/zhlt/clipnode.map">An example map is available</a>, 
demonstrating how it is possible to reduce the clipnodes in a map.  Without the clip brush
in place, the map requires over a hundred more clipnodes to define the player-accessable space.<br>

<h2>ALL YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT A SKY BOX:</h2>
<i>The method which has been described is called a sky box. THIS IS 
EVIL! NEVER USE THIS METHOD! Ok.. now that i'm done flaming sky boxes, 
I'll go into an explanation.<br>
BSP maps consist of two separate areas. The level area, and the outer 
void area. When a map is compiled, both MUST be included in the map, or 
the compiler will not work correctly. The compiler defines the "inner" 
level area by entities and the "outer" void area by a lack thereof. When
 the compiler cannot distinguish between the inner and outer area due to
 a lack of a boundary, entities on both sides of the boundary, or simply
 no entities at all, a leak is generated.<br>
<br>
When an entity is specified with a leak, that entity is (99% of the 
time) not the problem, but is simply the closest entity to the problem. 
Instead of just simply deleting that entity, you must find the cause of 
the leak (hopefully you haven't deleted your entire level already). 
There are many methods to this. The pointfile method, the leakfinder 
program, and the block (not skybox) method. Each of these has been 
discussed many many times (and is in the Hammer/WC help file if you take
 a look ).<br>
<br>
<br>
What happens when you make a skybox:<br>
<br>
- Your r_speeds will get much worse<br>
- Your map will take longer to compile<br>
- You will no longer have leaks, but at a high cost<br>
- Your map will be a larger file than neccessary<br>
<br>
What is not good about a skybox:<br>
<br>
- The outer walls of your map are compiled along with the inner walls, 
creating a lot more work for the VIS and RAD programs, making the 
compile much slower.<br>
<br>
- In game, r_speeds will rise significantly because the engine will have
 to draw the outside of the level at times as well as the inside.<br>
<br>
- You will lose valuable file space to the outside faces of your map. 
This will increase your map's file size and limit the number of objects /
 walls you can place in your map.<br>
<br>
How do I make a skybox:<br>
<br>
I hate to tell you so you don't go and make one. However, since I want you to avoid this method, I 
will tell you what NOT to do.<br>
<br>
A skybox is simply a very large box drawn around the entire level, then hollowed out.<br>
So use SKY instead as a "lid" for each section, or put it behind the glass in windows.<p>
One more thing to Know:<br>
Skyboxes are the epitome of newbieism. I have a policy in which I will 
make a point to delete any map in which a skybox is used. You will 
notice such a method is not used in any distributed maps nor in 90% of 
the maps out there.
